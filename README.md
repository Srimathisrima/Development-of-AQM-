*Project Title: IoT Air Quality Monitor (AQM)* 

 *Overview* :
The IoT Air Quality Monitor (AQM) is designed to measure and monitor air quality in real-time. It collects data on various air pollutants and provides this information through a user-friendly interface for both local and remote monitoring.

 *Components* :

 *Hardware* :

Air quality sensors (e.g., MQ series sensors for CO2, CO, and PM2.5)
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
Wi-Fi/Cellular module (for IoT connectivity)
Power supply
Enclosure
 *Software* :

Embedded firmware for data collection
Cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) for data storage and analysis
Mobile/web application for user interface
Project Steps:

 *Hardware Setup* :

Connect the air quality sensors to the microcontroller.
Power the system appropriately.
 *Firmware Development* :

Write firmware to read data from the sensors.
Implement Wi-Fi/Cellular connectivity to transmit data.
 *Cloud Integration* :

Create an account on a cloud platform and set up a database.
Develop a script to send sensor data to the cloud.
 *Data Analysis* :

Use cloud services to analyze and visualize air quality data.
Set up alerts for abnormal readings.
 *User Interface* :

Develop a mobile app or web interface to access air quality data.
Display real-time data and historical trends.
Allow users to set preferences and receive notifications.
 *Testing and Calibration* :

Calibrate the sensors to ensure accurate readings.
Test the system in various environments.
 *Deployment* :

Install the AQM in locations of interest, such as homes, offices, or public spaces.
 *Optional Enhancements* :

Add GPS for location-specific data.
Include additional sensors for humidity and temperature.
Implement machine learning for predictive analysis
